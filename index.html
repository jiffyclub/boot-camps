<p>A boot camp is an in-person, example-driven workshop, typically two
or three days long. A boot camp covers the core skills needed to be
productive in a small research team: basic programming skills, version
control, testing, using the shell, and relational databases.</p>

<p>Short tutorials alternate with hands-on practical exercises, and
participants are encouraged both to help one another, and to try
applying what they have learned to their own research problems during
and between sessions. Participants usually work on their own computers
(typically laptops), using either native software or a standard set of
packages running in a virtual machine. This ensures that they have a
working environment when the boot camp is done.</p>
